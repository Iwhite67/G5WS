# Get5-Web API Plugin
Plugin For My Forked Get5-Web Panel.

This plugin is to be used in conjuction with [get5-web](https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/get5-web) that I have pulled and made various modifications to. It includes various changes, such as tracking vetoes to a database, and uploading the demo of a match once the match is completed.

# Requirements
In order to compile this and use it on a server, you must have:

- [REST In PAWN](https://github.com/ErikMinekus/sm-ripext)

Once these requirements are met, you may build the plugin with `spcomp`.  
If you do not wish to build from source, the latest version of the 
plugin is both available in the releases [get5-webapi](https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/get5-webapi/releases/download/latest/get5_apistats.smx).

The extension REST In PAWN is required in order to run this.

# Thanks To
[splewis](https://github.com/splewis) for the initial plugin. It was stated that this could be used as a modified product, or forked.
